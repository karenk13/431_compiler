If statement infinite loop for print (points to itself)
Weird double labels when printing sometimes
Make the header for ARM and LLVM (.com and .text etc)
make end of function things for arm  (eg section	.rodata)
Display the arm labels of blocks corerctly (eg with the dots)
fix print statement in ARM


notes:
ARM: always declare the __aeabi_idiv

Load is empty, haven't implemented Store LLVM
declare -> dont need to do?
